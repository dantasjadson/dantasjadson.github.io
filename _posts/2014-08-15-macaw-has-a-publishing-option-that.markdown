Macaw has a publishing option that leads to a preview window. Unlike Reflow, Macaw offers options for exporting, under “Publish Settings.” In the dialog box there, you can choose which pages to export, inject code (such as for Google Analytics) into the head or body, tailor the CSS to your needs (by writing shorthands, adding vendor prefixes, consolidating styles, etc.), generate optimized images for high-definition screens and more.
The settings tell you that the generated code isn’t just for show. Once you publish, you are taken into a preview window, where you can view all of the code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and even go to preview the page in your default browser. Of the three applications, Macaw’s code is the most concise and the closest to what a front-end developer might actually write.
